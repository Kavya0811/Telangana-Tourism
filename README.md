# Important Insights
Seasonal Visitor Peaks: The dashboard shows peak tourist arrivals during the summer months (June to August), with a noticeable drop during winter. This seasonal pattern suggests focusing marketing efforts on off-peak seasons to balance visitor distribution.

Top-Ranked Destinations: Certain destinations, such as [Hyderabad,Warangal], consistently rank as the most visited spots, contributing to over 60% of total tourist traffic. This insight can guide resource allocation to ensure these locations remain attractive and well-maintained.
